## 8.1 Generated Persistence based upon Domain Model

MaMa uses a code generator to generate all (!!) required persistence
code from a UML entity model. The overall concept of this generation is depicted
in the following diagram. Generic and campaign-specific parts are stereotyped
in this diagram. The «campaign-specific» Data Management component is
automatically created and packaged by the build process.

![Overview of Code Generation](../images/8-code-generation-overview.png)

|Element|Applicability |Description|
|--|--|--|
|Core Domain Model |«generic» |UML model containing the generic classes and relations every MaMa instance needs. |
| | | |
|Core Domain Data Management |«campaign-specific» |Handwritten code, some Hibernate stuff, some generic finder and repository methods. |
| | | |
|Specific Domain Model |«campaign-specific» |UML model enhancing the Core Domain Model. |
| | | |
|Data Management |«campaign-specific» |Java jar archive generated by the code generator specifically for a campaign. Name and ID of campaign is contained in metadata, so different instances of this element are distinguishable, e.g. for audit or revision purposes.|
| | | |
|[Code Generator](../08-crosscutting-concepts/) |«generic» | not shown in diagram. |

This concept relies on the following prerequisites:

### Prerequisites:

* Every MaMa instance will handle data related to individual
  people - called _clients_ in MaMa domain terminology.
* All clients will have a small number of common attributes.
* For all productive campaigns MaMa needs to handle an arbitrary number
  of additional attributes.

* Every mandator will _add_ several campaign-specific attributes to
  the client, and/or will add campaign specific types (like insurance-contract
  or mobile-phone-contract)
* Once configured prior to campaign start, these campaign specific data structures
  will rarely change[^didnotchange]

[^didnotchange]: In several years of MaMa operation, data structures within an active campaign always remained fix, therefore MaMa did never need any data migration utilities...

### 8.1.1 Generic Domain Model ("MaMa-Core-Domain")

![MaMa Generic Domain Model](../images/8-generic-domain.png)

|Element|Description                                 |
|-|-|
|Client|Abstract class, representing a person plus corresponding contact information.  |
| | |
|Contact|Contact information that will be used for contacting the client instances during campaign execution. |
| | |
|Next Action   |Generic class describing campaign activities. Central to the concept of [campaign process control](../08-crosscutting-concepts/) and business rule execution |

### 8.1.2 Example for a Campaign Specific Domain Model

Specific campaign models always contain a (physical) copy of the complete
core domain. The abstract Client class always need to be subclassed, and might
be 1:n associated with additional classes.

### 8.1.3 Generator Details

* MaMa uses OpenArchitectureWare to generate the complete persistence code.
* Generation relies on the open source Hibernate O/R mapping and persistence framework.
* The generator generated the following elements:
  * DDL code to create database, schema, tables and indices.
  * Hibernate mapping files
  * Campaign specific implementations of `findClientByXY`, `findNextActivity` and similar  methods
  * A number of campaign- and configuration specific methods for reporting and monitoring
* m:n associations are not supported
* modifications of data structures are not possible when campaigns are already active.  

Due to nondisclosure agreements with InDAC we cannot show example source code
for the persistence concept.

**Alternatives**

* Initially MaMa had started with AndroMDA code generation framework, but
that open source project lost popularity, could not deliver the required support and
ceased working with newer Maven releases - so MaMa switched to OAW.
* MaMa uses the commercial MagicDraw UML (in version 9.0)
modeling tool, which can in principle generate code
based upon models, but proved to be too inflexible for the desired Hibernate integration.
The contracting entity (InDAC) refused to upgrade to newer versions or alternative tools.

## 8.2 CSV Import / Export

* TODO: Describe (some) details of the CSV configuration DSL
* TODO: Describe (customized) Eclipse editor for these DSLs

## 8.3 Configurable File Filters

As explained in the runtime scenario ["import raw"](../06-runtime-view/),
every file read during import from an external source needs to be transformed
via configurable filters. We most often have two kinds of filters, encryption
and compression.

The names and required parameter settings for every filter is managed
as part of the activity configuration within a campaign.

### Encryption filters

Encryption filters are compliant to the Java Cryptography Architecture
([JCA](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html)),
interfaces.

We urge mandators and partners to use crypto providers from
the [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html) portfolio.
Encryption and decryption filters need credentials or certificates
as part of their configuration.

>Due to the sensitive nature of data handled by the original MaMa system
>the owner required strict nondisclosure in that aspect. Therefore we are
>not allowed to go into any detail of security.

### Compression filter

MaMa supports only losless compression algorithms,
Compression can be configured to be either DEFLATE (as used in zip or gzip)
or varieties of Lempel-Ziv compression. Compression filters have
no parameters.

## 8.4 Rule Engine for Process and Flow Control

### 8.4.1 Flow of Action

### 8.4.2 Drools as Rule Engine
MaMa uses the open source rule engine [Drools](https://www.drools.org) for definition, implementation and
execution of business rules. Rules are defined as text files, which is interpreted
at runtime by the rule engine. This enables modification and maintenance of
rules without recompilation and redeployment of the whole system.

On the other hand, faulty rules can seriously hamper an active campaign – therefore
modification of business rules shall always be thoroughly tested!

Rules always have a simple “when `<A>` then `<B>`” format, where `<A>` and `<B>` are Java expressions.

You find a complete reference and many examples of the rule language at
[Drools documentation home](https://www.drools.org/learn/documentation.html).
